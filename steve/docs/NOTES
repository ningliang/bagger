This is a general place for notes to be placed and kept.

The general architecture of cobra/steve:

cobra/steve/... - the main "steve" python codebase.  has the following subdirectories:

crawler - tools related to crawling and local caching of HTTP requests.  Also an interface
          to allow you to iterate over the fetched results

grinder - tools related to processing large amounts of raw input (e.g. that output by the
		  crawler) and generating clean, standardized output

codecs  - tools related to reading and writing data as produced or consumed by other tools.
          for instance, this will contain the code to read and write the "ning+steve common data language" format.

third_party - various third party libraries and tools

util    - various commonly useful tools that are in some sense cross-module

app     - the basic python applicatin framework used by all apps in cobra.steve - handles
		  things like parsing commandline flags, setting up logging, and other such
		  application-level macros

scripts - various "binary" python scripts that are meant to actually be executed, rather than just
          imported.  this is where ALL final executable code is store.

docs    - a place for all documentation.
