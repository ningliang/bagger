Alright, time to write your opus.

We divide things into Boxes - things that take inputs and produce outputs - and Pipes, or things
that take streams as input and produce the same stream as output.  

**Are Boxes essentially Pipes?  Yes, although there is a difference: Boxes deal with computation
on elements of a stream, while Pipes simply move the elements around.***

Now, in the construction of a Flow, Boxes are the nodes and Pipes are the edges.  Thus, abstractly,
a Pipe...
  from the point of view of the writer, is completely unimportant
  from the point of view of the runtime, is the most important part


Pipes implement:
  sharding (e.g. of a file)
  hash-based sharding
  moving data from one CPU to another
  







class FlowElement(object):
  pass


class Box(FlowElement):
  pass


class Pipe(FlowElement):
  pass
